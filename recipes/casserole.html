      <li>1 white onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>

      <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon chipotle chile powder</li>
      <li>1 cooked chicken, torn into shreds or cut into chunks</li>
      <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>10 corn tortillas, cut into quarters</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Saute onion, red bell
        pepper, and green bell pepper in hot oil until warmed through, about 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine onion-pepper mixture, cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken
        soup, diced tomatoes, chicken broth, sour cream, cumin, ancho chile
        powder, oregano, and chipotle chile powder together in a large bowl and
        stir until sauce is well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a few tablespoons of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
        baking dish. Spread 1/2 the chicken over the sauce. Spread about half
        the sauce over the chicken and top with 1/3 the cheese. Spread a layer
        of tortillas over the cheese. Spread remaining 1/2 the chicken over the
        tortillas, and top with almost all of the remaining sauce, reserving 1/2
        cup sauce. Top with 1/3 the cheese, remaining tortillas, the reserved
        1/2 cup sauce, and remaining 1/3 cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.
        Increase the oven temperature to broil. Broil the casserole until top is
        golden, 2 to 3 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
